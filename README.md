You can easily translate any language using Google translator, but creating your translator will be a satisfying experience as a programmer. The googletrans API created by Google developers was used earlier to translate any text using Python. But now the new API from the Google developers known as google_trans_new is used for the same task.

You can use this API for every task that you can do with the google translator. You can easily install this library in your systems by using the pip command; pip install google_trans_new. To make a translator more interactive I will also create an interactive user interface by using the streamlit library in Python.
