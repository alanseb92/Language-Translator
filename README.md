You can easily translate any language using Google translator, the googletrans API created by Google developers was used earlier to translate any text using Python. But now the new API from the Google developers known as google_trans_new is used for the same task.

You can use this API for every task that you can do with the google translator. You can easily install this library in your systems by using the pip command; pip install google_trans_new. To make a translator more interactive I will also create an interactive user interface by using the streamlit library in Python.

We need to run this code using the streamlit and  run the  file using  command in your terminal. After running the file a link will open in your default browser with an interactive user interface. In the text field, you can enter any text in any language, once you hit enter it will translate it to French as I have mentioned ‘fr’ as our target language in the code.
